# Bulma Stylus

This is a Stylus translation of the [Bulma](http://bulma.io) CSS framework.

Bulma Stylus aims at a 1:1 functional parity with the latest version of [the original Sass-based Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma).


## Installation

Either grab `bulma.css` from the `css/` folder, or,

    npm install bulma-stylus

or perhaps even

    bower install bulma-stylus


## Documentation

Since Bulma Stylus is functionally identical to the original Bulma, you can refer to the original [Bulma documentation](http://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/) for instructions.

All variable names are the same. The only caveat is that if you wish to customize the `$colors` variable, you must adhere to the Stylus hash format. Refer to the default value in `/stylus/utilities/variables.styl:133` for an example.
